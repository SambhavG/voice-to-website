***COMPONENT***

This is a Svelte component with potentially incorrect syntax. Correct it so that it follows the following rules:
1. All opening tags must be closed, especially script and style tags.
2. There are no errors created by the code.
3. There are no props exported without default values. Ideally, there should be no props at all
4. The component should be in the classic Svelte 4 style of a script block, an html block, and a style block. It is ok if it is missing one of these blocks. If it is not in this order, however, reorder it.

Change the code as little as possible so that it follows these rules. The code should be clean, orderly, polished, and performant. It should be the same in style to code that a professional would write.
